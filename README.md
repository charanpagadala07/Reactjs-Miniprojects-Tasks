# Reactjs MiniProjects
## **Hey There !ðŸ™Œ** This is a repository where you find my Reactjs mini projects or tasks which i have developed as a React NewBie. I have used bun inorder to implement these projects. The above projects are Vite + React
## *Why bun rather than npm/npx ?*
**Bun** is designed to handle package management tasks significantly faster than NPM, making it appealing for developers looking to streamline their workflow. Despite being new, Bun's compatibility with NPM packages ensures ease of adoption without the need to change existing projects.
 Inorder to run these projects, you'll have to install bun in your systems. You may install bun using :
#### **1. Run this Command to install bun :**
 ```bash
npm install -g bun
```
After successfully installing bun, you can verify if bun is installed using the command:
#### **2. Run this command to check bun installed:**
```bash
bun --version
bun-v
```

## 1. Calculator
  **Calculator** is implemented using only the useState hook for managing state and the onChange event for handling input. It performs basic arithmetic operations and serves as a fundamental introduction to React state management and event handling.
#### **Run the command `bun run dev` to run**
