# Reactjs MiniProjects
## **Hey There !ðŸ™Œ** This is a repository where you find my Reactjs mini projects or tasks which i have developed as a React NewBie. I have used bun inorder to implement these projects. The above projects are Vite + React
## Why bun rather than npm/npx ?
**Bun** is designed to handle package management tasks significantly faster than NPM, making it appealing for developers looking to streamline their workflow. Despite being new, Bun's compatibility with NPM packages ensures ease of adoption without the need to change existing projects.
```bash
bun create vite
